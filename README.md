# Youtube-Scrape-Pipeline

## Description
Work during Spring25 in SocWeb Lab, with PhD candidate Jiawei Zhou's project on Risk Communication.
Made this repository public for other lab-members' /developers' convenience.

## Main Use
Collect Youtube video data & metadata with customized keywords as filters.

## Technology
Written in Python, **.py** files for the convenience of being run on server.

## Process
Before you run, please do pip install in the terminal to install all required pacakges (I can add a requirements.txt file later).
Run as the following:
  datafetch_merge.py -> transcript_fetch.py -> merge_all.py
  
## Outcome
A .csv file with all video data & metadata based on your keywords.

## Code to be cleaned
1. The same pipeline using the official API
2. Topic Modeling on video metadata
3. Simple visualizations for channel data.
4. Scraping for other platforms.

## Please leave comments if you run into any issue.
Thanks.
